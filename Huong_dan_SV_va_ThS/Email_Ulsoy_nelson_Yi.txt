Asking for help with your recent article

Dear Prof. Nelson, Prof. Ulsoy and Dr. Yi,

Let me introduced myself. I am Phi Ha, a mathematician working on Delay Differential Equations. 

Recently, I am very much interested in the Matlab toolbox LambertWDDE 
http://www-personal.umich.edu/~ulsoy/TDS_Chapters/Toolbox.htm
written by your working group. 
I also have a pleasure to read several research articles written by your group from 2003-2014, in particular the article
"
Analysis and Control of Time Delay Systems Using the LambertWDDE Toolbox
"

Nevertheless, it appears that there is not any example in the toolbox about solving DDEs presented in Examples 2 and 3 in the above mentioned article. 

Furthermore, while trying to simulate these examples, I obtained different matrices C^I_k as the presented result in the article. The results I have is obtained by using the built-in command of the toolbox

[CI,flag] = find_CI(A,Ad,h,Sk,g,x0);

for Example 2 (A = -1; Ad = 0.5; h = 1; B = 1; g = [1]; x0 = [1]; u = @(t)sin(t))

are different from this article 

C_I = -2.0073+0.1168i  -2.0109+0.1863i  -1.9829+0.4711i   1.0713+0.0000i  -1.9829-0.4711i  -2.0109-0.1863i  -2.0073-0.1168i


C_I = 0.0016+0.0005i   0.0038+0.0015i   0.0197+0.0111i   0.9422+0.0000i   0.0197-0.0111i   0.0038-0.0015i   0.0016-0.0005i

So could you help me to overcome this matters? Thank you very much in advanced.

With best regards,
Phi Ha.
