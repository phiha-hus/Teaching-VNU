%NEWTON Finds function zeros.
% ZERO=NEWTON(FUN,DFUN,X0,TOL,NMAX) tries to find the
% zero ZERO of the continuous and differentiable
% function FUN nearest to X0 using the Newton method.
% FUN and its derivative DFUN accept real scalar input
% x and return a real scalar value. If the search
% fails an error message is displayed. FUN and DFUN
% are function handles associated with anonymous fun-
% ctions or Matlab functions.
% ZERO=NEWTON(FUN,DFUN,X0,TOL,NMAX,P1,P2,...) passes
% parameters P1,P2,... to functions: FUN(X,P1,P2,...)
% and DFUN(X,P1,P2,...).
% [ZERO,RES,NITER]=NEWTON(FUN,...) returns the value of
% the residual in ZERO and the iteration number at
% which ZERO was computed.
