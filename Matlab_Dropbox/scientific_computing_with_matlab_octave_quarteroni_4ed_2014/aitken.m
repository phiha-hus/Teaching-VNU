function [x,niter]=aitken(phi,x0,tol,nmax,varargin)
%AITKEN Aitken's method.
% [ALPHA,NITER]=AITKEN(PHI,X0) computes an
% approximation of a fixed point ALPHA of function PHI
% starting from the initial datum X0 using Aitken's
% extrapolation method. The method stops after 100
% iterations or after the absolute value of the
% difference between two consecutive iterates is
% smaller than 1.e-04. PHI is a function handle
% associated with an anonymous function or a function
% stored in a m-file.
% [ALPHA,NITER]=AITKEN(PHI,X0,TOL,NMAX) allows to
% define the tolerance on the stopping criterion and
% the maximum number of iterations.
